      <h2>Welcome to the St. Petersburg Widget</h2><br>
      You need to be authenticated to play<br>
      It is super simple though, the authentication works by just joining this room:
      <p id="roomLinkP" style="text-align: center;"></p>
      The Widget will check if you have joined this room and you can play. This serves two purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>First I can estimate how many
          people play this widget. If this exceeds the realm of a tech demo and is a competitor to official platforms
          I can inform the publisher and a solution can be found.</li>
        <li>The second advantage is, that the authentication-room can also be used
          to quickly ask for help or serach for ppl to play with!</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="display: flex;justify-content: center;margin: 0 20%;">
        <button style="flex-grow: 1;" id="tryAuthenticationButton">I joined the room, try again!</button>
